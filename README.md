To build and run the project, you will also need to make sure to download the model and vocab files from HuggingFace.

The model is here: https://huggingface.co/optimum/all-MiniLM-L6-v2.

Place `model.onnx` and `vocab.txt` in the `model` directory.


For point in time, here is a link to the direct commit of the model in case it changes: https://huggingface.co/optimum/all-MiniLM-L6-v2/tree/10244843eba3d9e479b27a4b81c94b56d8e9f4f2
